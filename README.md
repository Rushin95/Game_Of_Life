# Game_Of_Life

Game Of Life is a fun game that revolves around creating engaging patterns. Once the application is open, user can easily start the game straight away.

On the Game Play Window, the grid is automatically created according to the size of the screen. The size of the each cell is set default irrespective of the dimensions of the screen. The red dots on the grid show the a live cell and blank places show the dead cells.

Pressing the 'Next' button moves the grid to the next step and user can see the next formation of the pattern according to rules of Game of Life , which are mentioned as follows:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies .
2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours will come to life.

'Reset' button will clear the grid for a fresh start. The user will be prompted for confirmation through a dialog box before the grid is finally being reset.


Have fun...!!!!!
